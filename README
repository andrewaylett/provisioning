An example of provisioning a web server using salt, running in Vagrant.

To bring up, run `vagrant up`.

To test, run `./test.sh`.

This is a fairly simple example -- we rely on Vagrant to bootstrap salt for us,
running without a master.  The salt state files in ./salt/ provision the
service, ensuring that apache is installed and running and putting the rather
bare-bones website in place.  We forward port 80 in the VM out to port 8080 on
the host.

The test script verifies that the web server has been set up correctly -- it
downloads the front page and verifies that it's the same as what's deployed.
